To-Do List App app allows users to create, edit, and delete tasks with due dates and priorities, as well as mark tasks as complete or incomplete. Users can register, log in, and log out, and their tasks are stored securely in a PostgreSQL database.

Setup
1. Create a PostgreSQL database to connect to. Save the database credentials for the next step.
2. Create a .env file inside the backend folder. It should contain the following environment variables (replace the values for the database with your own):
DATABASE_URL=postgres://your_database_username:your_database_password@localhost:5432/your_database_name?sslmode=disable
3. From the command line, navigate to the backend folder and run npm install to install the necessary dependencies for the API.
4. From the command line, navigate to the frontend folder and run npm install to install the necessary dependencies for the React app.
5. In separate terminals, run npm start in each folder so that the API and React app are running at the same time.
